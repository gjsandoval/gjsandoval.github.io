I am an Assistant Research Professor at the [Biostatistics Center](https://biostatcenter.gwu.edu/) at the [Milken Institute School of Public Health](https://publichealth.gwu.edu/) at the [George Washington University](https://www.gwu.edu/). I work as a statistician for the Eunice Kennedy Shriver NICHD [Maternal Fetal Medicine Units (MFMU) Network](https://mfmunetwork.bsc.gwu.edu/) and for the [Prenatal Genetic Diagnosis by Genomic Sequencing](https://biostatcenter.gwu.edu/projects/prenatal-genetic-diagnosis-genomic-sequencing-prospective-evaluation-prenatalseq) study. 
&nbsp;
I received a BS in Mathematics from the [University of Texas at Austin](https://www.utexas.edu/) in 2007, an MA in Biostatistics from [Boston University](https://www.bu.edu/) in 2009, and a PhD in Biostatistics from the [George Washington University](https://www.gwu.edu/) in 2021 under the direction of Drs. [Ionut Bebu](https://biostatcenter.gwu.edu/people/research-faculty/ionut-bebu) and [John Lachin](https://biostatcenter.gwu.edu/people/research-faculty/john-m-lachin). Prior to joining the Biostatistics Center, I worked for 7 years as a biostatistician at [PROMETRIKA, LLC](https://www.prometrika.com/), a contract research organization located in Cambridge, Massachusetts. My research interests include the design of clinical trial and epidemiological studies, cost-effectiveness analysis, and healthcare resource utilization.
